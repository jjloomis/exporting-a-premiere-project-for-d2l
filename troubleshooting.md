## Computer is trying to open the template file in Photoshop

If your computer tries to open the template file in Photoshop, you may have accidentally left-clicked \(aka, "normally clicked"\) the template file link \(instead of control-clicking it.\) If this happens, Safari will download the file and then your operating system will automatically try to open it \(using Photoshop.\) The template file type will confuse Photoshop and Photoshop will give you an error message.

1. Quit Photoshop.
2. Download the export-settings-for-d2l-videos.epr file using the steps outlined in [Exporting a Premiere Project for D2L](/exporting-a-premiere-project-for-d2l.md).
