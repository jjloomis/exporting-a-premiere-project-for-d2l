# Exporting a Premiere Project for D2L

Unlike YouTube, which compresses a video when you upload it, D2L "points" to your video when you upload it. So you need to do the video compression yourself \(otherwise the video wonâ€™t play well over an internet connection.\)

## Downloading the export settings template file

You'll download the export settings template file \(EPR\) to your project folder, but you won't actually open it like you would a normal file. In the next section, you'll use the template file's settings to export your project.

1. Control-click this link: [export-settings-for-d2l.epr](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/jams-downloadable-files/templates/export-settings-for-d2l-videos.epr). In the fly-out menu, choose **Download Linked File As**.
2. In the Save As box, navigate to and select your project folder.
3. Click **Save**. The export-settings-for-d2l.epr file will download to your project folder.

## Using the template file to export your project

You'll import the template file into your Export Settings box. The template file's settings will populate the Export Settings box. Then you'll export your MP4.

1. In Premiere, make sure the Timeline panel is selected.
2. Go to **File** on the menu bar. Select **Export** and choose **Media**.
3. In the Export Settings box, go to the Preset area \(upper-right.\) Click the **Import Preset** button \(folder with arrow pointing to the right.\) 
4. Navigate to and select export-settings-for-d2l-videos.epr file \(in your project folder.\) Click **Open**.
5. In the Choose Name box, leave the default name in the Please name this preset field. Click **OK**. The preset will populate the Export Settings area. 
6. In the Output Name area \(top-right\) click the current name of your MP4 file \(_the-current-name-your-sequence.mp4_.\) It looks like a blue hyperlink. 
7. In the Save As box, give the MP4 a new name and location. When finished, click **Save**. 
8. In the Export Settings box, click **Export** \(lower-right.\) Your MP4 will export to your project folder.
