# Exporting a Premiere Project for D2L

Unlike YouTube, which compresses a video when you upload it, D2L "points" to the video you upload. So you need to do the video compression yourself (otherwise the video wonâ€™t play over an internet connection.) 

## Downloading the export settings template file

1. Control-click this link: export-settings-for-d2l.epr. In the fly-out menu, choose **Download Linked File As**. 
2. In the Save As box, navigate to and select your project folder.
3. Click **Save**. The export-settings-for-d2l.epr file will download to your project folder.

## Using the template file to export your project

1. In Premiere, make sure the Timeline panel is selected.
2. Go to File on the menu bar. Select **Export** and choose **Media**.
3. In the Export Settings box, go to the Preset area (upper-right.) Click the **Import Preset** button (folder with arrow pointing to the right.) 
4. Navigate to and select export-settings-for-d2l-videos.epr file (probably in your Downloads folder.) Click Open.
5. In the Choose Name box, leave the default name in the Please name this preset field. Click OK. The preset will populate the Export Settings area. 
6. In the Output Name area (top-right) click the current name of your MP4 file (the-current-name-your-sequence.mp4.) It looks like a blue hyperlink. 
7. In the Save As box, give the MP4 a new name and location. When finished, click Save.
